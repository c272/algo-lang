# Contributing

### Basics
When contributing to the language, make sure to:
* Create detailed but concise pull requests which describe in entirety what the PR changes within the codebase.
* Change the contents of pull requests as required for their merging into the main branch.
* Be civil to other developers.

### Code Style
The basic C# style will suffice, meaning:
* Tabs not spaces.
* Curly braces should be on a separate line.
* PascalCase for public functions and type declarations.
* camelCase for private or local fields, properties and variables.
* Use "var" sparingly, try to strongly type.

Thanks!
